# _Anita Kemp's SW US National and State Parks API and MVC Application_

#### _As part of the week 13 code review for Epicodus, 11/1/19_

#### By _Anita Kemp_

## Description
_This API is a database of the state and national parks of the SW United States. Currently, there is a list of the national parks (and some of the state parks) for New Mexico and Colorado. With the MVC application, the user will be able to add other state and national parks of the SW (e.g. NM, CO, AZ, UT)._

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* _Clone this repository_
* _Navigate to the "Parks" directory, and run dotnet ef database update_
#### To make an API call without the MVC app - the endpoint is: localhost:5000/api/ParksApi

#### To use the MVC application:
* _Run dotnet run_
* _In a separate terminal navigate to ParksClient and run dotnet run_
* _Navigate to localhost:5004_
